        <img src="../img/pbj.png">
        <p>Folks, this is about as simple as you can get</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Peanut Butter (Crunchy or Creamy depending on your preference)</li>
            <li>Jelly (I prefer strawberry, but grape or any other is also acceptable)</li>
            <li>Two slices of your chosen bread</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Apply Peanut Butter to one side of one slice of bread, completely covering the face of the bread</li>
            <li>Apply Jelly to other slice of bread, in the same manner that you applied the peanut butter to the first slice</li>
            <li><strong>This is very important and where novice sandwich makers typically make a grevious mistake.</strong> Apply peanut buttered side of the first slice, to the jellied side of the other slice, preferably so the rounded "heads" of both slices are touching</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Pro-Tip</h4>
        <p>Crunchy PB is better. If you want to get <em>real crazy</em> then get one of those flavored peanut butters. I really enjoy the white chocolate flavor from Peanut Butter Co.</p>
