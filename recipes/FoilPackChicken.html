        <h1>Creamy Salsa Verde Foil Pack Chicken</h1>

        <p>Full disclosure, this recipe was <em>entirely stolen</em> from <a href="https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/foil-pack-creamy-salsa-verde-chicken-rice-veggies/">Cheslea's Messy Apron</a>.
        I've been making this recipe ever since college as it is inexpensive, ridiculously easy, delicious and filling! The process of making this recipe is basically tossing all the ingredients together in foil and then roasting, so it's extremely simple.
    This delicious dish can be dumped on a plate and eaten as is, but I like to shred the chicken once I'm done, mix the dish together in a bowl, and then use the result as quesadilla/taco/burrito filling. Read the directions below and I hope you enjoy!</p>
